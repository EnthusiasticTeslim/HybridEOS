Authors: Teslim Olayiwola, Luis A. Briceno-Mena, Christopher G. Arges, Revati Kumar, Jose A. Romagnoli,

Welcome to this repository! It encompasses code and resources tied to knowledge-informed machine learning for electrochemical separation processes.

## Directory Structure

1. `data`: Houses requisite data files crucial for the hybrid modeling, including datasets, preprocessed data, and other data-centric resources.
2. `notebooks`: Encompasses interactive examples, tutorials, and documentation for leveraging the code housed in the `source` directory.
3. `source`: Stores the source code related to various components of the molecular generation pipeline, encompassing scripts, modules, and packages crucial for implementing the enlisted algorithms and methods.
4. `models`: A space to save trained models, model weights, and associated artifacts.
5. `reports`: Contains presentation decks, images and other report-related files.
6. `references`: Holds key reference papers significant to this project.
